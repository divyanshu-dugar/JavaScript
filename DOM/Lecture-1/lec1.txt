DOM (DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL - document is a model/representaion of our HTML code) - Tree Like Structure (each box representing a node/object)
- DOM is a way of accessing HTML code using JS.
- Dynamic changes during runtime, when user accesses the website can only be done by JS.
When a webpage is loaded, the browser automatically created a DOM.
DOM tree starts with a window object - This containes everything.
Window is a global object
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HTML code -> JS (converts into an object called 'document' - available in window object [present in JS])
window.document - This will fetch us the entire HTML code.
console.dir(window.document) - To view the properties

console.log - To print something on the screen - we do not use this to print special objects
console.dir - Prints properties or methods of special objects (for eg. document)
Both these are parts of window object
